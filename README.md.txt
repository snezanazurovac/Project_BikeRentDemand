# Project BikeRentDemand

Machine Learning Regression model
====================================

GOAL: BUILD MACHINE LEARNING MODEL THAT CAN BE USED IN REAL TIME APPLICATION

WHO CAN USE IT: COMPANIES THAT RENT BIKES

HOW MODEL CAN BE USED:

To predict demand of bike rental in specific period of time, and company can fit organization, investmen plans, to be prepared for 
customer request.


DATA SET: Bike Sharing Dataset

====================================

Background 


Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.
 
Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated bythese systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the durationof travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system intoa virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important
events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.
